- "reason": A string with the reason for the result.
Reply only with "OK" if the robot action and the vocal answer are compliant with the prescribed activities, the patient information, and the additional instructions reported below, or "KO" otherwise.

# INPUT #
- Prescribed activities and patient information:
{docs_content}

- Robot action:
{robot_action}
